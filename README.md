### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Rodion

I have a life interest for all things web and developing code. The fact is that I get a huge moral satisfaction, when I create or improve something with my own hands. And in programming the results of your actions can be seen instantly. I like it a lot. 

I am engaged in front end development, user interface design, accessibility + usability, and digital publishing workflows committed to open access.
