### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Rodion

I have a life interest for all things web and developing code. The fact is that I get a huge moral satisfaction, when I create or improve something with my own hands. And in programming the results of your actions can be seen instantly. I like it a lot. 

I also enjoy wireframing, UI, UX and design in general.
